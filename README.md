## Software Methodology
The waterfall method was used in the software development life cycle of this project. Because the dates of the phases in the project development process have already been determined, this method is used. 
The waterfall method is the most common software development methodology and serves as the foundation for all other models. The steps of analysis, design, implementation, and testing are generally carried out in four stages. 

## Software Architecture
The Trust Me App based on many external frameworks and libraries such as Firebase (ML, Real Time Database, Authentication, Storage Libraries), GSON, Glide, TensorFlow. The system works with some of these frameworks and libraries in Android Studio (Java). System uses Firebase DB for storage all information about users including face pictures of them. Also, Firebase used for server connections.
